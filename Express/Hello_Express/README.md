# Hello Express

Create a folder called "Hello_Express" and give it a file called "server.js". This file will be our Node server file.

Since Express is a node module, run npm install express while in the Hello_Express directory.

Note: If you are on a Mac you may need to run this command as sudo. 

All that this did was go out and install the express module (as well as all of the modules that express is dependent on) in your project folder. Your project folder should now contain a big new scary "node_modules" folder in addition to your server.js file! Feel free to poke around and see what is inside, but do not delete or change anything. Try to trace where require("express") from our server.js code goes and what it comes back with.

Run the server.js file using node (but use nodemon, it will make your life easier) and see the magic happen!
